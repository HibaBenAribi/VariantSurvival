## Preamble 

_TODO : we expect that structural variant calling was done and VCFs are present. We/I can potentially add another How-to later._ 

## Merge VCFs across samples

_TODO : use [SURVIVOR](https://github.com/fritzsedlazeck/SURVIVOR), [Jasmine](https://github.com/mkirsche/Jasmine) or [svimmer](https://github.com/DecodeGenetics/svimmer) to merge SVs_

## Annotate genes in the multi-sample VCF file

_TODO : gff overlap right now? GeneVar soon?_
